# Developer-Focused Backend Features & Requirements

### (C++ Computation Engine + Python API + PostgreSQL DB)

---

## 1. Core Computation Engine — **C++**

### Algorithms to Implement:

* Brute Force
* Dynamic Programming (DP)
* Backtracking
* Greedy Heuristic
* Hybrid (combined methods)

### API Design:

* Provide a clean C++ function interface, e.g.:

  ```cpp
  Solution solve_subset_sum(const std::vector<int>& project_costs, int budget, const std::string& algorithm);
  ```
* Return:

  * Selected project indices
  * Total cost
  * Execution time
  * Memory usage
  * Status (exact/approximate)

### Performance & Optimization:

* Profile with gprof/Valgrind
* Optimize for memory and speed
* Consider multi-threading or SIMD for large datasets (optional)

### Integration:

* Expose the computation engine to Python via:

  * Pybind11 preferred for ease and modern C++ support
  * Alternative: Cython, ctypes, or cffi for bindings

---

## 2. API & Orchestration Layer — **Python (FastAPI)**

### Responsibilities:

* Accept and validate input (project list + budget)
* Interact with PostgreSQL database (SQLAlchemy ORM)
* Call C++ computation engine through Python bindings
* Manage performance profiling and logging
* Prepare data for visualization and analytics
* Provide RESTful endpoints for client consumption

### Core API Endpoints:

* `POST /solve/`:

  * Input: projects + budget + optional algorithm
  * Output: solution details + execution stats

* `POST /datasets/` and `GET /datasets/{id}/`:

  * Manage project sets and budgets

* `GET /results/{run_id}/`:

  * Fetch prior computation run data

* `GET /benchmark/` (optional):

  * Run comparative performance tests

### Input Validation:

* Use Pydantic models for strict validation and typing
* Sanitize and verify numeric fields and constraints

---

## 3. Data Layer — **PostgreSQL**

### Database Models:

* **ProjectSet**: Container for projects, metadata, ownership info
* **Project**: Project name, cost, associated ProjectSet
* **Budget**: Budget amount tied to a ProjectSet
* **AlgorithmRun**: Stores algorithm used, results, timing, memory, match type
* **AnalyticsSnapshot** (optional): Benchmarking data per algorithm/input

### Implementation Details:

* Use SQLAlchemy ORM with Alembic for migrations
* Store flexible metadata in JSONB fields if needed
* Index frequently queried fields for performance

---

## 4. Performance Monitoring & Analytics

### Profiling:

* Collect and store:

  * Execution time (from C++ and Python layers)
  * Memory usage (C++ profiling + Python `memory_profiler`)
  * Algorithm accuracy (exact or approximate)

### Logging:

* Structured JSON logs with timestamps, API calls, algorithm info
* Error tracking and alerting

### Benchmarking:

* Support batch runs with randomized datasets
* Track algorithm scalability (small, medium, large inputs)

---

## 5. Visualization & Reporting (Python)

### Responsibilities:

* Generate plots and execution flow charts (Matplotlib, Plotly)
* Provide visualization data for frontend or reporting tools
* Optionally, produce downloadable reports or export files

---

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing:

* C++: Unit tests for all algorithms, edge cases
* Python: API endpoint tests, input validation

### Integration Testing:

* End-to-end flow including DB interaction and C++ calls

### Performance Testing:

* Measure execution time/memory under varied input sizes

---

## 7. Deployment & Operations

### Containerization:

* Docker images for:

  * Python FastAPI API server with C++ bindings
  * PostgreSQL database with volume persistence

### CI/CD:

* Automate build, test, and deployment pipelines for both C++ and Python codebases

### Security & Reliability:

* Input sanitization
* Transactional integrity on DB writes
* API rate limiting and authentication if needed
