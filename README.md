# Budget Allocation using Subset Sum Algorithms

---

## Overview:

This project implements various algorithms (Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, Greedy, etc.) to solve budget allocation problems modeled as subset sum. Users can manage projects, assign metadata (priority, risk), and get optimal selections within given budgets. Includes visualization and analytics.

---

## Key Features:

- Multiple algorithm implementations with performance comparison
- Support for time-phased and multi-department budgets
- Priority and risk-based weighted selection
- Interactive visualization and analytics dashboard
- API for integration with other systems

---

## Tech Stack:

- Python (Backend algorithms)
- FastAPI (Backend API)
- React or Streamlit (Frontend UI)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Docker (Deployment)

---

## How to Run:
```
rm -rf cpp/src/build
cmake -S cpp/src -B cpp/src/build
cmake --build cpp/src/build


```
