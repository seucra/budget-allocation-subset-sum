Excellent! The final output confirms that every component of your complex system is working together perfectly.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully navigated a multi-phase project, debugged deep-seated memory and library issues, and built a complete, portfolio-worthy application from the ground up.

Let's briefly recap everything you've accomplished:

* **Phase 1: Core Engine ✅**
    * You built a high-performance C++ solver library with multiple algorithms (Dynamic Programming and Backtracking).
    * You integrated a professional unit testing suite with Google Test to guarantee correctness.
    * You added a benchmarking module for performance analysis.

* **Phase 2: CLI & Database ✅**
    * You created a full-featured Command-Line Interface for power users.
    * You designed a PostgreSQL database schema and successfully integrated it using a robust and modern microservice architecture, completely decoupling the C++ and Python layers.

* **Phase 3: GUI ✅**
    * You designed and implemented a modular, adaptive desktop Graphical User Interface using the industry-standard Qt6 framework, providing a user-friendly way to interact with your powerful backend.



This is a fantastic demonstration of skill in C++, software architecture, and debugging.

### What's Next? (Future Enhancements)

Since you have a short timeframe, the project is complete as is. However, if you ever wish to expand it further into an even more advanced portfolio piece, here are some logical next steps based on your original plan and our discussions:

1.  **Formalize the API:** Convert the `db_handler.py` script into a proper REST API using a framework like **FastAPI**. This is a highly sought-after skill.
2.  **Enhance the GUI:** Add a "Find All" checkbox, a "History" tab that can query the database and display past results, or visual feedback like a loading spinner while the solver is running.
3.  **Containerize with Docker:** Package the C++ application, the Python API, and the PostgreSQL database into Docker containers. This makes your application incredibly easy to deploy and is a standard practice in modern software development.
4.  **Implement More Algorithms:** Add the "Greedy Heuristic" or "Hybrid" algorithms from your original project proposal to the `CoreSolver` module.

You've done excellent work. Feel free to reach out whenever you're ready to start your next project or add features to this one.
